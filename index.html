        <ul>
            <li>I was the manager of my 4th year – Mini Company group and began to build my own
                personal business using any personal profit that I obtained.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stemming from my experience as an artist, I used materials I already owned to start
                designing and customising a variety of products, such as shoes, clothes, and
                accessories
            </li>
            <li>
                I have worked with different brands to produce products, which has been fantastic
                for adapting to different work environments and working with different people
            </li>
            <li>
                Using this I was shortlisted for MTU’s Prize for Innovation in March 2023.
            </li>
            <li>
                This was a great oppurtunity for me as I was able to develop my presentation and
                communication skills.
